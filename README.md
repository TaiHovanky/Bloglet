# practice-social-media-app
Practice social media app used for me to improve my skills with Node, GraphQL, TypeORM, GraphQL, Apollo and React. Its functionality is fairly simple so far. A user can register themselves,
log in, create posts, and view the posts of another user. As of 7/12, I'm working on adding functionality for a Like/Favorite button.

To run it, clone the repo, run "npm install", and then open two separate terminal tabs. In one, cd into ./web and in the other, cd into ./server. Use the "npm run start" command in both.
